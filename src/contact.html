  <h2>🦄 <a href="https://github.com/LinusOstlund/infinity-quiz">Infinity Quiz</a></h2>
  <p>Infinity Quiz is a quiz game that I made to learn more about OpenAIs API. It is randomizing question from
    category, and subcategory tuples, and provide answers with different personalities <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

  <h2>👁️ <a href="https://github.com/siberov/PRoofreader/tree/python-init">Proofreader</a></h2>
  <p> After spending lots of time proofreading Github README's, me and a collegue wanted to automate the
    process. Proofreader opens a pull request for every push and reviews the README, coming with suggestions and
    corrections. We used
    OpenAIs API with function calls to decide when a correction was due, and we integrated the corrections into
    Githubs GUI. <br><br>It does work, but the utility is arguably quite low in it's current state (look at <a
      href="https://github.com/siberov/PRoofreader/pull/3">this PR</a>🤪). It is spewing suggestions for every
    paragraph (or are we just poor writers?). The corrections are not idempotent, so it just keeps on correcting already
    proofread paragraphs.
    The project is on hold for now, but could be fixed and extended to incorporate code (e.g, automatic code repairing
    with pretty pull requests).
