    <h1>👷🏼‍♂️ Projects</h1>
    <p>I've gathered projects from my free time here. Each title link to the corresponding Github repository. </p>
    <h2>🦄 <a href="https://github.com/LinusOstlund/infinity-quiz">Infinity Quiz</a></h2>
    <p>Infinity Quiz is a quiz game that I made to learn more about OpenAIs API. It is randomizing question from
        category, and subcategory tuples, and provide answers with different personalities <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

    <h2>👁️ <a href="https://github.com/siberov/PRoofreader/tree/python-init">Proofreader</a></h2>
    <p> After spending lots of time proofreading Github README's, me and a collegue wanted to automate the
        process. Proofreader opens a pull request for every push and reviews the README, coming with suggestions and
        corrections. We used
        OpenAIs API with function calls to decide when a correction was due, and we integrated the corrections into
        Githubs GUI. <br><br>It does work, but the utility is arguably quite low in it's current state (look at <a
            href="https://github.com/siberov/PRoofreader/pull/3">this PR</a>🤪). It is spewing suggestions for every
        paragraph (or are we just poor writers?). The corrections are not idempotent, so it just keeps on correcting
        already
        proofread paragraphs.
        The project is on hold for now, but could be fixed and extended to incorporate code (e.g, automatic code
        repairing
        with pretty pull requests).

    <h2>🎶 <a href="https://github.com/LinusOstlund/DD2424-project">Symbolic Music Generation</a></h2>
    <p> A project made for the course <a href="https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2424?l=en">DD2424 Deep Learning
            in Data Science</a>. We coded two models (LSTM and Transformer) from scratch in PyTorch to generate
        MIDI, and trained on a pop music dataset. We used <a href="https://mlflow.org">MLFlow</a> to monitor and export
        the model, experimenting with various features such as <a
            href="https://github.com/LinusOstlund/DD2424-project/blob/main/MLproject">MLproject-files</a> (e.g,
        Makefiles for ML-projects). With some boundaries on the data, we managed to produce something similar to music.
        Looking at the Github repo, it <i>should</i> be reproducible from any machine. At the final poster session, it
        was crowned
        second coolest project of our course iteration! 🤩</p>
