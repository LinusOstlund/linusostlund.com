    <p> I am studying Computer Science and Machine Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
      My particular fields of interest is in Data Science, ML and DevOps. I am passionate about automation and
      efficiency. <br><br>

      In the summer of 2023, I was an intern at VitalSigns Innovation, a medtech startup. I focused on how to use LLMs
      to make healthcare personel more efficent, and implemented various chatbots in Python. <br><br>

      In 2022, I was a research assistant in a team investigating how to harden the software supply chain, a project
      called <a href="https://chains.proj.kth.se/">CHAINS</a>.
      Prior to researching, I was a teacher assistant (TA) for a CS1/2 course that covered Java basics, data structures
      and complexity. <br><br>

      I wrote my bachelor thesis on student code quality in the above mentioned course, through the lens of static code
      analysis. It was accepted to the paper track (Computing Education Research) at the <a
        href="https://sigcse2023.sigcse.org/">2023 SIGCSE symposium</a>. You can find it at <a
        href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545945.3569829">ACM.</a><br><br>

      Before my studies, I attempted to become a Swedish Justin Bieber. I did not succeed, but my music is still
      available on Spotify 😊 <br><br>
